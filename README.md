# PTPPM - Peer-to-Peer Pipeline Manager

## Description
PTPPM is a revolutionary peer-to-peer pipeline management application. Designed to provide maximum flexibility and total independence, it allows teams to collaborate in real-time without relying on a centralized server. With its distributed pipeline system, every user becomes a node in the network, ensuring continuous availability and enhanced data security.

## Key Features
- **Peer-to-Peer Collaboration**: A fully distributed system that allows users to share files, synchronize tasks, and manage pipelines without requiring cloud infrastructure.
- **Advanced Pipeline Management**: A powerful engine to automate workflows, orchestrate tasks, and track process evolution in real time.
- **Integrated Version Control**: A versioning engine that tracks file history, restores previous versions, and manages contributions from multiple users.
- **High-Performance OpenGL Rendering**: A graphics engine optimized with GLFW and Glad for a smooth and responsive experience.
- **Advanced User Interface**: Built with ImGui, the UI is intuitive and customizable to suit different project needs.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Powered by ASIO, users benefit from instant and secure peer-to-peer communication.
- **Authentication & Permissions**: Advanced user management with role-based access control to ensure data security and structured collaboration.
- **Local SQLite Database**: Efficient project data storage with options for export and synchronization.
- **Project Organization & Structuring**: Tools to create teams, assign tasks, manage resources, and centralize all project-related information.

PTPPM is designed for artists, developers, studios, and businesses seeking a free and secure environment to organize their pipelines and automate their production workflows. With its decentralized technology, users retain full control over their data while enjoying seamless collaboration.

This project is entirely free and open-source. We believe in a future where pipeline management is no longer dependent on expensive infrastructure, allowing everyone to work efficiently without external constraints. Join the community and optimize your production with PTPPM!
